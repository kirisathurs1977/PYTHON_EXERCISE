"""The centigrade scale, which is also called the Celsius scale, was developed by Swedish astronomer Andres Celsius. In the centigrade scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. The centigrade to Fahrenheit conversion formula is:
Fahrenheit and centigrade are two temperature scales in use today. The Fahrenheit scale was developed by the German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit . In the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees."""
